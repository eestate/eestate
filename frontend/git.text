Initial State (Hidden):
display: block;: The element is a block-level element, but its dimensions and opacity make it invisible.
position: fixed;: This is crucial. position: fixed takes the element out of the normal document flow and positions it relative to the viewport. This allows it to stay in a fixed position even when the user scrolls.
top: 0px; right: 918.4px; bottom: 729.6px; left: 0px; width: 0px; height: 0px;: These positioning and sizing properties, particularly the width and height being 0px, ensure that the overlay initially has no dimensions and doesn't cover anything. The specific right and bottom values look like remnants from its hidden state or potentially part of an animation origin, but with width and height at 0, they don't define the visible area.
opacity: 0;: The element is completely transparent, making it invisible.
zIndex: 9997;: A high z-index ensures that when the overlay becomes visible, it will likely appear on top of most other content on the page.
Transition/Animation (Becoming Visible):
transition: opacity 0.2s 0.2s;: This property indicates that when the opacity of the element changes, the transition will take 0.2 seconds to complete, and there's a delay of 0.2 seconds before the transition starts. This suggests that when the overlay's opacity is changed from 0 to 1, it will fade in smoothly.
Triggering Visibility (Likely on Click):
Although not directly visible in the CSS properties alone, the fact that you are asking how it works "when anyone clicks" strongly suggests that there is JavaScript code that listens for a click event (perhaps on an element that triggers the overlay, or maybe even a click within the overlay itself for closing).
When the click event occurs, the JavaScript code likely modifies the CSS properties of the .shot-overlay element. Based on the observed styles, the key changes would be setting width and height to 100% (or 100vw and 100vh) and changing opacity from 0 to 1. This would cause the overlay to expand to cover the full viewport and fade in, utilizing the defined transition property for a smooth visual effect. The position: fixed ensures it covers the entire viewport regardless of scrolling.
To implement this in your project:

HTML Structure: You'll need a div element for your overlay, similar to the selected element:
Code

<div class="my-overlay">
        <!-- Content for your overlay (e.g., a modal, image, form) -->
    </div>
Use code snippets with caution

CSS for Initial State (Hidden):
css

.my-overlay {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 0; /* Start with 0 width and height */
        height: 0; /* Start with 0 width and height */
        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); /* Example semi-transparent background */
        opacity: 0; /* Start hidden */
        z-index: 9999; /* Ensure it's on top */
        transition: opacity 0.3s ease, width 0s 0.3s, height 0s 0.3s; /* Transition for opacity, delay width/height change */
        overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */
    }

    /* Alternative initial state using display: none */
    .my-overlay {
        display: none; /* Start hidden */
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
        z-index: 9999;
    }
Use code snippets with caution

Code

*   Using `width: 0; height: 0; opacity: 0;` with transitions provides a fade-in/expand effect.
*   Using `display: none;` is simpler for hiding/showing but doesn't allow for CSS transitions on `display`. You'd likely combine `display` with `opacity` for a fade effect if using this method.
Use code snippets with caution

CSS for Visible State:
css

.my-overlay.is-visible { /* Add a class to control visibility */
        width: 100%; /* Expand to cover the width */
        height: 100%; /* Expand to cover the height */
        opacity: 1; /* Become fully visible */
        transition: opacity 0.3s ease; /* Transition for opacity */
        /* If using the display: none method, change display: block here */
        display: block;
    }
Use code snippets with caution

JavaScript to Toggle Visibility on Click:
js

const triggerElement = document.getElementById('your-trigger-element'); // The element that when clicked opens the overlay
    const overlayElement = document.querySelector('.my-overlay');

    triggerElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
        overlayElement.classList.add('is-visible');
        // Optional: Add a class to the body to prevent scrolling when overlay is open
        document.body.classList.add('overlay-open');
    });

    // Add a way to close the overlay, e.g., clicking on the overlay itself or a close button
    overlayElement.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        // Check if the click was directly on the overlay, not its content
        if (event.target === overlayElement) {
            overlayElement.classList.remove('is-visible');
            document.body.classList.remove('overlay-open');
        }
    });

    // Add a close button listener
    const closeButton = document.querySelector('.my-overlay .close-button');
    if (closeButton) {
      closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        overlayElement.classList.remove('is-visible');
        document.body.classList.remove('overlay-open');
      });
    }
Use code snippets with caution

Code

*   This JavaScript adds an event listener to a trigger element. When clicked, it adds the `is-visible` class to your overlay element, which applies the styles to make it cover the screen and fade in.
*   You'll also need a mechanism to close the overlay (e.g., clicking a close button inside the overlay or clicking the overlay background). The example includes listeners for clicking the overlay background and a potential close button.
Use code snippets with caution

Optional: Prevent Body Scrolling: When an overlay is open, you often want to prevent the main page from scrolling. You can add CSS to your body element when the overlay is active:
css

body.overlay-open {
        overflow: hidden;
    }
Use code snippets with caution

Code

And in your JavaScript, you'd add/remove the `overlay-open` class on the `body`.
Use code snippets with caution

By combining position: fixed, initial hidden state styles, a class to control visibility, CSS transitions, and JavaScript to toggle the visibility class on a click event, you can create a similar full-screen overlay effect in your project. Remember to consider accessibility and provide a clear way for users to close the overlay (e.g., using the Escape key, a close button, or clicking the background). Using newer features like the inert attribute could also be beneficial for accessibility by preventing interaction with elements behind the active overlay.
